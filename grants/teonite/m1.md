### Description

There is a well-known issue that could impact the feasibility of creating a smart contract verification service for Casper Network - the WASM deployment on the blockchain is pre-processed on the node, meaning the WASM binary on-chain is not the same as the one uploaded by the developer.

This is an RnD (Reasearch & Development) milestone and the goal is to tackle this critical issue and recreate or reverse the pre-processing to compare with the binary created by compiling the source code.
Our analysis shows (please see the detailed analysis chapter below: WASM binary processing analysis), that we should be able to recreate the binary optimization process performed on the blockchain node while executing the finalized block but that needs actual RnD work to confirm it (or state otherwise) - thus this milestone.

There also was uncertainty about the Rust compiler itself producing deterministic builds - but from our research code translation methods are now based on pseudocode for a very long time - in other words, the compiler works deterministically by translating to its higher-level pseudocode, optimizing it and then switching to real asm.


### Acceptance Criteria

Deliverables:

1. Recreate the binary optimization process performed on the blockchain node while executing the finalized block with a Rust crate and a simple command line tool that uses the same mechanisms as the casper-node.

2. Create tests that will either prove that itâ€™s possible to produce the same WASM build as the node does or will fail and state there is no possibility to do so without chaining the node/core CSPR services.

If the reproduction process succeeds - next milestones are valid, if the reproduction process and tests fail next milestones will not be realized.



WASM binary processing analysis
Below is a general description of how the smart contract binary is processed within the system before being stored on the blockchain. The analysis is based on the latest releases of relevant components:
casper-node v1.5.0-rc.1 (a50b85a)
casper-client-rs v1.6.0 (63a311a)
casper-wasm-utils v1.0.0 (035ba8c)
WASM/Deploy processing flow
developer compiles smart contract source code into a .wasm file
developer sends the binary to a node as part of a Deploy by using the casper-client CLI
https://docs.casper.network/resources/quick-start/
the client attaches the binary as-is and sends the Deploy to a JSON-RPC endpoint on the specified node
https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-client-rs/blob/63a311afbd3e29d3424b4eb2f620468603a17510/lib/parsing.rs#L507
https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-client-rs/blob/63a311afbd3e29d3424b4eb2f620468603a17510/lib/parsing.rs#L606
request is received and RpcServerAnnouncement::DeployReceived event is added to API event queue; the event is actually immediately converted to Event::Accept type associated with MainReactor

DeplyAcceptor receives a new Deploy and verifies it complies with chain configuration and is not expired

DeplyAcceptor fetches highest block header and account associated with deploy from storage; this data is used to check if given account is authorized to submit the deploy (has sufficient weight, matches with required approvals)
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/node/src/components/deploy_acceptor.rs#L284

DeplyAcceptor checks if account main purse balance is sufficient to pay for the Deploy

DeplyAcceptor validates payment and session logic

DeplyAcceptor validates cryptographic signatures of a Deploy

Deploy is put to storage
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/node/src/components/deploy_acceptor.rs#L859
new Deploy announcement is put in event queue and a response is sent to JSON-RPC client
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/node/src/components/deploy_acceptor.rs#L905

new Deploy is gossipped to peers
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/node/src/components/gossiper.rs#L83
consensus mechanism works to finalize a block
the finalized block is executed by the execution engine
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/node/src/components/consensus/era_supervisor.rs#L1043

at this point, the WASM binary used by the execution engine is the same one that the user submitted
to install the contract the binary contains a bit of session code (the call method) which defines the entrypoints and calls the new_contract method which is actually an FFI call to a host function provided by the Execution Engine
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/smart_contracts/contract/src/contract_api/storage.rs#L100

the host function generates new WASM binary with only the relevant entry point methods included (stripping the call method itself and any unused methods from the user-provided binary)
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/execution_engine/src/core/runtime/mod.rs#L1663
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-wasm-utils/blob/master/src/optimizer.rs#L16
this modified binary is the one that is actually stored in global state
https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/a50b85a910a4c49b60e5cb2402de336d85aff6c6/execution_engine/src/core/runtime/mod.rs#L1693
