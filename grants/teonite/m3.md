### Description

Having reproducible and coherent builds done, next the public validation service will be implemented with the following functionalities: source code storage, code validation, and REST API to communicate with the service.


### Acceptance Criteria

a web proxy (public) microservice implementing:
authentication and authorization for end users to be able to communicate with the service
REST API of the service with RUST DOC documentation of the service and/or OpenAPI 3.x document specification

Storage microservices - that will store all relevant data:
source code with all metadata information (developer, dates, etc.)
WASM builds with all data from the distributed build system (metadata, build logs, etc.)
validation data - cryptographic data of Smart Code Validation with all data (logs of that operation, etc.)  

Validation microservice - a microservice written in Rust and integrated with Hardware Security Modules (initially with Nitrokey HSM 2 security module) that will implement cryptographic operations for Source Code and WASM bytecode validation and produce validation data
