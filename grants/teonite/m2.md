### Description

The next stage of the critical path in delivering the service is the build system that will enable to:
do distribute builds in order to support asynchronous builds for scaling the service
support various versions of Rust compilers for builds - we donâ€™t know which Rust compiler version the developer will use - and there is a possibility (to be checked in the milestone) that various different Rust versions will produce slightly different WASM bytecode - thus the verification on-chain would fail - thus the build system needs to support multiple versions
support various versions of casper-library (same as above)
use the reproducible WASM deployment mechanism from the previous milestone



### Acceptance Criteria

A microservice (or microservices) based on Docker with API 
Code should be delivered in Rust
Microservice is secure (define authentication and authorization for the build microservice) and executes jobs to build Smart Contracts from source code
As a result, WASM bytecode should be the result with all required metadata about the build details (versions, libraries, etc)
