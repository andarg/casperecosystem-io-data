Dappium is a no-code web3 builder. If you are a web2 developer (e.g. a game studio) and want to tap into web3 but don’t want to build and maintain a blockchain development team, then you use Dappium. It creates all the smart contracts you would need automatically for you. It also gives you a web2 SDK to access your smart contracts from within your app code. 

You just select from the menu of web3 use cases, fill in web forms, click buttons to describe the system what you want. Dappium takes care of the rest, isolating all the technical complexities of web3 from the user. If there is any functionality missing in your automatically created smart contracts, i.e. any parameter missing in the relevant forms you fill in, you fill in the tailor section of the form, and we develop it for you free of charge and add it to the code generator stack. This unique loop has helped and will continue to help the Dappium no-code tool progress in an evolutionary manner; provides the user the experience of having a tier-1 web3 team in house; brings open-source reusability to no-code efficiency, and enables a fine mix of flexibility and constraints (for security and optimization). 

The smart contracts can cover all your needs such as crypto currency, entire tokenomics, staking, raffles, DAO contracts, NFT collection minting & management, marketplaces, wallets, loot boxes, more flexible and niche needs, etc. Dappium encompasses contract development, deployment (testnet and mainnet), management, utility, API, RPC infrastructure, etc. The platform isolates all the technical complexities of advanced Web3 systems from the Web2 developer (e.g. how do i get interoperability, what is bridging, multi-chain, custodial wallet, fiat friendly option, hybrid/single sign-on authentication, decentralized storage, etc.). Dappium partners with ecosystem players to achieve 360 service through a single platform. 

Furthermore, web2 developers who are interested in web3 are scared of security issues and vulnerabilities. Hacking stories per capita is much higher in web3. One of the reasons Dappium team embarked on the mission is to force and spread best practices for optimization & security on web3 implementations. We do not want smart contract developers to introduce vulnerabilities on and around smart contract level. 

All the co-founders are prominent computer scientists and electronics engineers with a great deal of start-up experience involving high tech security software development. Dr. Guven Fidan and his team has developed many security frameworks and software middleware for banks, etc. If you Google “super-rational attack” you will see one of the many posts written by Ersin Taskin (a co-founder) on the Cryptography maillist on web3 security. Ersin Taskin is co-founder and CTO of Kod-A the developer of GreenDocs. Salih Kanli is the co-founder of CBKSoft developing enVision™ BPM and DMS, which is used by government institutions, banks, utilities, universities, etc. All their web2 enterprises has evolved around a high level of security. Detailed credentials can be provided.
