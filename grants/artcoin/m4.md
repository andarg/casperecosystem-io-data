**Details of what will be delivered in this milestone:**
- ArtCoin exchange service functionality (Front-end)
- ArtCoin transactions fee generation smart contract
- ArtCoin balance transfer smart contract

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Source code
   1. We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can use Simple Minter functionality 
2. Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. 
3. This functionality is working as cdn because it is installed as script into body element of any website or through tag manager. Therefore, the docker file is unnecessary for this milestone
