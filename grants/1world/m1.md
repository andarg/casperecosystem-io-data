### Description

First milestone will include integration of the NFT widget with Casper minted Collection. 
The result of the integration will be the use case to distribute Casper’s NFTs through the 1World NFT Widgets, show the collections (with rotation options), and allow users to buy or claim these NFTs via in-place credit card (built into the widget). This case provides the ability of wide distribution of NFT Collections (and digital assets in general) across the wide variety of publisher networks / audiences / inventory..

Primary - 1World platform supports Casper’s NFT collections;
1World NFT widget shows the collection on the 3rd party / Publisher page;
The user can assign a Casper wallet via the Widget UX.
