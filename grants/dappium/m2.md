### Description

After getting the core Dappium functionality on Casper Network and getting our no-code crypto currency generator module, we then implement our no-code tokenomics module. In this module the user can design, test and deploy the entire tokenomics smart contracts for a token on the Casper Network, securely & no-code.

### Acceptance Criteria

Criteria 1: Users are able to design, develop and deploy entire tokenomics for a token no-code using Dappium UI/UX.

How to check: 
- Go to Dappium as a registered user.
- Select a token, click Tokenomics and then Create Tokenomics. 
- Enter tokenomics round information (Name, various vesting conditions, cliff, TGE, supply, whitelist). 
- Click Save. 
- Get the address of the relevant smart contract. 
- Check the smart contract deployment on https://cspr.live/. 
- Interact with the smart contract with your wallet (Casper Wallet, Torus). (I.e. transfer tokens).
- Create and test the entire tokenomics smart contracts with all tokenomics round information combinations like whitelisted or not, various vesting conditions, cliff, TGE, supply, etc.
- Inspect the smart contracts.
