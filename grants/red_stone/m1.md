### Description

Prepare an in-depth analysis of differences between EVM and Casper from the point of view of our protocol:
● Check available cryptography functions (ECDSA signer recovering, keccak256 hashing)
● Check available timestamp details in the context of transaction
● Analyse the gas costs structure, compare computing and storage costs
● Analyse available data types and language features of the Rust language
● Find the best way of attaching RedStone oracle payload to the transactions


### Acceptance Criteria

The Redstone team knows exactly what work needs to be done to successfully deploy our infrastructure on the Casper blockchain. Confirmed in the Telegram message or Email form by the RedStone team.
