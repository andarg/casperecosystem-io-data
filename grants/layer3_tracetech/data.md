The main goal of the project is to offer a new product to HEMAV's current customers. 

This product must cover the needs for traceability and certification of the origin of agricultural products during the import process to Europe. 

The aim of this project is to provide a layer of decentralization and transparency to the process carried out by HEMAV, and to make this process unalterable and externally consultable.
