### Description

This phase includes the development of the tokenization feature and smart contracts to enable the use of the building blocks in business processes. This will involve 
writing code, testing, and debugging to ensure that the tokenization and smart contract functionality is fully functional and secure.

### Acceptance Criteria

Demonstration by means of a interface where smart contract will be deployed and the building block modules working will be demonstrated by integrating it with 
a wallet.
