<!--lang:en--> 
Direct CSPR Staking (DCS) is a Casper Mainnet Validator supporting its delegators by providing access into the Casper Network, providing the ability to stake their $CSPR tokens providing full support to all our delegators. Always making sure we have the most competative staking fee in the TOP 100 Validator list, allowing our delegators to be reassured they are maximising their Return on Investment (ROI). Now with TWO NEW DCS Datacentre Nodes fully dedicated to the Casper Mainnet this enables us to operate secure & fully complient datacentre grade hardware, making sure we are able to process every block in every Era. Operating a FULL Mainnet hotspare node allows us to maintain a fully secure and updated OS able to take over for hardware fault or maintenance tasks.
