Invariant is a fully permissionless AMM DEX featuring a concentrated liquidity mechanism. Our project allows retail users to swap their tokens easily but also provides the opportunity for newly launched projects and liquidity providers to create their pools, gives a unique distribution formula for the most efficient liquidity, and reuses capital locked in the platform on other protocols thanks to tokenized positions. A concentrated liquidity mechanism makes Invariant more profitable and efficient than a standard AMM and makes it a natural liquidity hub which benefits the whole ecosystem.
